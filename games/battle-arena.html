How to Play Battle Arena
In a world overrun by demons, you must choose a region at a time to combat your opponent. Battle Arena fights start off in Serenity Valley, where you can assess your enemy's squad in just a tap. You get to select your heroes for battle. You begin with only three heroes to play with, each with a different weapon and skill. But the amount of heroes you can eventually upgrade to is countless.

Early in the game, you will fight Dark Lord, who is less than happy to see you. To win the initial battle and every one afterward, you must use your hero's unique skills—some wield swords while others shoot arrows. Just tap on their avatars at the bottom of the screen to strengthen your attacks.

In Battle Arena, your objective is pretty much to build and upgrade your heroes and compete in various challenges, particularly in the arena. The gameplay revolves around gathering resources and gaining experience points to level up. Players can participate in raids to acquire new heroes and enhance their existing ones. The key to success in this game is to strategize by selecting the right battle heroes to maximize team effectiveness.

As you engage in battles, you must use different abilities and relics, which provide unique advantages during combat. Upgrading heroes is crucial to improve your performance in battles.

Always pay attention to your heroes' health and manage resources wisely, especially during expeditions and arena fights. Using a mix of heroes with complementary skills can lead to successful team combinations and help defeat stronger opponents.

Ultimately, the goal is to push through the ranks in the arena by strategizing hero placements and leveraging their abilities effectively. You can earn significant rewards as you progress, which can be reinvested into your hero roster.
