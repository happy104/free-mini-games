Assault Bots (previously Bot Machines) is an excellent real-time multiplayer vehicle battle game made by Blayze Games. Choose from an array of weapons, jump into the battlefield, and obliterate your opponents. Blayze games also make Bullet Force, Plated Glory, and more highly popular games!

Rebrand
The game has been rebranded as Assault Bots since 21 December 2020.

Bot Battles
The vehicular combat in Assault Bots is immense fun. The simple mechanics leave considerable room for you to harness your strategic and aiming skills to blow up your enemies, which quickly becomes an addictive and enjoyable experience.

Team Deathmatch
The game mode now uses team deathmatch. Work together with your teammates to eliminate as many opponents as possible within the time limit!

Capture the Flag (legacy mode)
As well as destroying the opposition, you must capture as many flags as possible, as this is the critical objective. You capture flags by keeping your vehicle within the capture range of the flag while defending your position against enemies. This is where you can implement your personal and team strategy to get a competitive edge over the other side!

Customize
One of the aspects of Assault Bots that keeps the gameplay fresh is the ability to switch up your arsenal of weaponry. In any game, you'll have two slots free to choose from an array of weapons, including a minigun, machine gun, RPG, grenade launcher, and more. Each weapon has its strengths and weaknesses.

You can also apply add-ons like health-regen and turbo, as well as customizing the body and movement of your vehicle to create your favorite Assault Bots for Battle.
