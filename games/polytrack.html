    <meta name="description" content="Play PolyTrack online for free at Free Mini Games. PolyTrack is a fast-paced, low-poly driving game featuring thrilling loops, jumps, and high-speed action where every millisecond counts. Inspired by TrackMania, it challenges you to race against the clock, constantly striving to improve your time on various tracks built by you and the Polytrack community! It doesn't get any more hands-on than that.

How to Play Polytrack
Polytrack is a classic car racing game with a slight twist. You race a car you customize and on a track you've designed yourself. This means you not only have to think about beating your own record when it comes to time, but you also need to master the craft of building for speed and precision.

Start by creating your track using the game’s design tools or choosing from pre-made tracks. Customize the track with various obstacles, ramps, and curves to suit your preferences. Don't know exactly what track to build? Get help from the Polytrack community. There are plenty of forums that share design codes and customizing tips.

With a built-in level editor, you can unleash your creativity by designing custom tracks. You can also export and share these tracks with others for endless racing (and design) fun.

The game will require time and patience, as you don't just go into it like other driving games, with your foot on the pedal and ready to rev and drift. Initially, the easiest tracks to build are straight lines, but as soon as you get the hang of it, you will have a track jumping over mountains, sending your car and score soaring.

A series of premade tracks is available for those who want to begin practicing and getting a feel for other designs.
