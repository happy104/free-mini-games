How to Play Mahjongg Solitaire
Spot the patterns

Mahjong is a tricky puzzle game. There are so many tiles, many of which look the same but feature slight differences. Along with the need to spot these patterns, you can’t move any pieces with both sides blocked. The left or right side needs to be accessible, at least.

Use hints when you’re stuck

Mahjongg Solitaire features hints if you get stuck, but unlike some other mahjong games, it does not have a shuffle feature. The games are also timed, meaning there is some urgency to how many tiles you can match.

When the game ends, you’ll get a score for the tiles you matched and a bonus for how far you got in the game before your time ran out.

Tile groups in Mahjongg Solitaire
Mahjongg Solitaire features 144 tiles divided primarily into three suits. The primary suits are:

Dots - feature circles
Bamboo - feature lines
Characters - feature Chinese characters
In Mahjongg Solitaire, you’ll also notice special tiles that can be matched even without the same image. These are highlighted in blue or green.
