How to Play QB Legend
It's football time and the game is on with QB Legend. Step onto the field and take control as the quarterback in this fast-paced football showdown! Your job is to pass the ball to a receiver running along the yellow lines. Once they catch it, keep running until you're tackled—the next play starts from that spot.

Use the keys or mouse to steer, and don’t forget you can spin once per play (press space or double-click) to dodge defenders. A down is a single play, and you have four plays to gain 20 yards—fail, and your opponent takes possession.

Score a touchdown by catching or running the ball into the end zone for 7 points. Each game consists of four one-minute quarters, and you need to be leading when the clock runs out to claim victory.

Want to stop the clock? Run out of bounds to buy yourself extra time, especially when every second counts.

That’s it, rookie—you're ready for action! The stadium is roaring, the helmets are lined up, and the pressure is on. Can you lead your team to glory?
