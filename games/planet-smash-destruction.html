How to Play Planet Smash Destruction
Your goal in Planet Smash Destruction is to destroy planets, essentially for the fun of it. You will journey to various planets and celestial bodies with nothing but courage and weapons to accompany you. Your weapons will help you on your path to destruction, but they also help reshape planets from their original form.

Planet Smash Destruction can be categorized as a sandbox game, so you get a significant amount of freedom to explore space, making each gameplay quite unique. Your imagination is the only limit to full space domination.

The game starts with a view from space of Earth -- it's just sitting there waiting to be destroyed. Fret not; if all feels overwhelming while destroying your homeland, you can always press reset while repeating the mantra - it's only a game, it's only a game.

Choose your weapon
There are several ways to destroy Earth and other planets. On the right side of the screen, select a weapon to destroy your chosen planet. For example, you can choose an alien monster drill to create a donut-like hole in the center of Mars. Or, if the planet is rotating close enough to you, you may want to detonate a bomb. Say goodbye to one or all seven continents with a few consistent laser shots. Want to practice your aim? Send a rocket out to see just how much you can destroy in one go.

The more planets you destroy, the more money you earn. Currency will get you upgrades and new planets to explore via a store purchase, allowing you to destroy even more worlds.

You can tweak your weapons via settings. You might enlarge your laser beam and change its color, make meteorites hit a wider area, move faster, or expand the blast radius of missiles. You can even unleash dozens of missiles for those peskier planets that are more difficult to destroy.
