    <meta name="description" content="Play Haunted School online for free at Free Mini Games. Haunted School is a horror survival game where you search a school for the tools required to exorcise a demonic child. Explore the map looking for clues and supplies. How long will you survive the Haunted School?

Search for answers
Roam the corridors of this ravaged school in search of answers. Solve the puzzles and find the priest's tools so you can banish the demonic girl before it’s too late.

Survive the horrors
Early in the game, you’ll find a shotgun. You can use this to shoot the girl away before she kills you, but it will only rid you of her temporarily. If you run out of ammo, then all you can do is run and hope you don’t become demon food. The priest has left notes as clues throughout the Haunted School. Follow them for advice.

Prepare for jump scares
Haunted School gets progressively scarier and utilizes jump scares and tension to put you on the edge of your seat. The vibe is similar to other famous survival horror games like Silent Hill and Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Expect unforgiving frights.

You can find more games like this in the horror and scary categories.
