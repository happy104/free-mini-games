    <title>Doodle Road - Free Mini Games</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Play Doodle Road online for free at Free Mini Games. Doodle Road is an imaginative and captivating 2D casual game that combines creativity with problem-solving. In this fun browser game, your primary objective is to draw a path that will successfully guide a car from the starting point to the finish line. With a multitude of levels to explore, each one introduces new challenges and exciting obstacles that test your creativity and strategic thinking. Draw your way to victory and see how far your creativity can take you!

How to Play Doodle Road
You start in Doodle Road by practicing drawing a straight line from the car to the target. Sounds simple, right? Wait until you see how straight your line really is! The true challenge is how easy it is for your car actually to drive across that path.

Next challenge – draw a line to the target, but now there's a wall in your way. Remember, your car can’t fly! So, think about how to draw your path – you don’t have to go over the wall; you can go under it! As you go, you'll see that drawing a straight line is harder than it looks. If you don’t start the line from behind your car, it’ll just dangle off into oblivion.

How do you get over an L-shape? Or a huge gap in the ground? And the challenges keep coming. By level 5, your engine shuts off, so you’ll need your physics brain to figure out how to use hills and momentum to get across.

Some levels have trampoline-like springs that’ll launch you toward your target. The challenges change each time, keeping you on your toes. Buckle up because it's going to be a bumpy ride, depending on how well you draw!
