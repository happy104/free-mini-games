How to Play Snake Shooter: Tower Battle
An enormous snake is slithering toward you, and the only way to stop it is by shooting its segmented body until each part is destroyed. Each segment has a numeric value representing its durability—keep shooting until the number reaches zero to break that section apart.

To survive, focus your attacks strategically. Aim for the segment closest to you to prevent the snake from advancing, or target weaker segments with lower numbers to shorten its length and buy yourself more time.

As you rack up points, you’ll unlock powerful upgrades:

🏹 Double Arrows – Fire two shots at once for extra damage.

🏹 Critical Hits – Boost your chance to deal devastating blows.

🏹 Explosive Arrows – Blast through segments with high-damage shots.

🏹 Attack Speed Boost – Fire faster to break down tough segments quicker.

🏹 Piercing Arrows – Hit multiple segments in one shot.

The battle intensifies as the snake grows faster and stronger, even gaining the ability to attack from a distance. Equip battle gear and level up to keep pace with its increasing power.

It's important to strategize. Be smart in your approach—strike the front to slow its advance, but take the shot if you see an opportunity to wipe it out entirely! Can you defeat the snake before it reaches you?
