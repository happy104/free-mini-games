How to Play Piles of Mahjong
Piles of Mahjong brings a fresh twist to the classic Mahjong formula with some exciting new dynamics. The game has most of the same foundational rules as a classic game of table mahjong, but instead of simply matching two tiles, your goal is to match three tiles from a pile featuring a mix of familiar patterns like circles and sticks, alongside fun new additions like bird and panda heads. To make a match, you must select tiles by clicking on them, and they’ll move to one of the seven empty spaces at the bottom of the screen.

But be careful! If you fill all seven spaces without making any triple matches, it’s game over. Strategic thinking is essential to clear the pile and avoid running out of space.

The game offers helpful features to assist you when you’re stuck, but they come with a price. You can reshuffle the tiles with 300 reward points or by watching an ad, flip all the tiles face up for the same cost, or even auto-match tiles in the bottom row with 100 reward points or an ad.

To add to the challenge, you start with two chances to remove a tile from the bottom area. Once those chances are used up, you will need to spend 100 reward points or watch an ad to earn another set of removals. These are useful if you are close to filling up your bottom spaces or if you find some tiles to pair with no space to move them to.

With its engaging twists and strategic layers, Piles of Mahjong tests your puzzle-solving skills while adding a bit of pressure to every move you make!
