    <meta name="description" content="Play Tap-Tap Shots online for free at Free Mini Games. Tap-Tap Shots is an addictive sports game in which you continuously tap to make your basketball jump. It is an endless basketball practice where you aim to get your ball in the net in one shot, so the goal is to keep playing until you can't anymore, so you may want to cancel all plans for the evening. Perfectly time your taps to score before the clock runs out, and keep going as long as you can!

How to Play Tap-Tap Shots
The gameplay in Tap-Tap Shots is fairly easy. It is a one-button game where each click propels your ball. Depending on your tap, your ball may or may not make the shot.

The net moves to a different height and location each time you make the shot. This will test your click skill. The game is, in essence, an endless series of rounds of practice shots. Your best scores are tallied, incentivizing you to be better than you were in the last round.

The key to the game is to find the right rhythm when tapping, hence the name tap-tap. How many taps do you need to make every shot?

Tap-Tap Tips
Keep tapping to move the ball slightly until it reaches the net. If you miss, the ball will come back from the other side.

When you score, another net is created in a new location—an endless cycle until you run out of time!

Time your shots carefully and think fast before you run out of time. If you miss, it’s best to click quickly to get back around and try for another shot, but make sure you don’t overshoot again!
